  "summary": "ValentinePage.tsx was modified to add collision/overlap-prevention logic for the evasive “No” button (including measuring button dimensions and checking overlap with a gap). However, due to truncation, resize/orientation-change handling cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Two additional non-requested metadata files were also modified.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the evasive “No” button never overlaps/touches the static “Yes! 💕” button after viewport/container resize or orientation changes (position corrected if needed).",
      "reason": "The diff snippet shows overlap detection and randomized re-positioning logic, but does not show any explicit resize/orientation-change listeners or reflow correction logic. Because the file content is truncated, this requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the provided evidence.",
